## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=13M0u0k3V4WaYgf7Lb1ac80gJaQ
Your Rationale: The dark monochromatic color makes it visually appealing. However, there is some color to give it a pop.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52m0u0kcglL4Zvw8Eq6eXhmkwen
Your Rationale: There is some green in there to match with the Botanical Gardne, but the rest of the colors can be normal advertisment colors.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=3000u0kaVz84jP27qHbeJtFiHpX
Your Rationale: The login page is colorful to be kid friendly.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=13u0u0k3V4WaYgf7Lb1ac80gJaQ
Your Rationale: This color scheme is sleak.
